# A KPI Gets Reported

<!--
Consider a scenario where we're reporting a series of key performance indicators on a 
regular basis. For this illustration, we're going to use just a single KPI. And,
to really keep things simple, we're not even going to say what the metric uses -- 
that's not actually relevant.
-->

# And It Includes Some Context...

<!--
The KPI will be reported with some context.
-->

# Comparison to a Target

<!--
Hopefully, that includes a comparison of the KPI to a target.
-->

# Comparison to an Earlier Period

<!--
And, it may include a comparison to the previous period or the same period last year.
-->

## And...Usually...A Trend of the Data

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

# Make a weekly chart of the data

# Aggregate the data to be weekly
ga_data_weekly <- ga_data %>%
  mutate(week = time_period - wday(time_period) + 1) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(sessions = sum(sessions)) %>% 
  mutate(last_week_sessions = ifelse(week == max(week), sessions, NA ))

# Chart it
ga_plot_weekly <- ggplot(ga_data_weekly, mapping = aes(x = week, y = sessions)) +
  geom_line(color = "#07077D", size = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(y=sessions), size=3, shape = 19, colour = "#07077D") +
  geom_point(aes(y=sessions), size=3, shape = 20, colour = "white") +
  geom_point(aes(y=last_week_sessions), size=4, colour = "#AD181B") +

<!--
And, generally, we include a trend of the data. This may show up as just a sparkline
on a dashboard, but for our example here, we're showing it as a full chart. This is an
example of a weekly report. The red dot shows the most recent week. We can see that the
results were down for the week. But, was the data down just due to noise, or, rather, 
does it seem that there is actually real movement in the metric that warrants additional
exploration?
-->


## Let's break that weekly data down to be daily.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

# Build a plot showing just the actual data
ga_plot <- ggplot(ga_data_plot, mapping = aes(x = time_period)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ga_data_plot$metric_all), color = "#07077D", size = 0.75) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, max_y)) +
  default_theme

ga_plot

```

<div class="my-footer-left"><img src="images/demystified.png" style="height: 22px;"/></div>
<div class="my-footer-right">&#64;tgwilson</div>

<!--
The first thing we need to do is break the weekly data down into daily data. We can now see
that the metric follows a pattern whereby it dips sharply on the weekends.
-->


## Last week is now the last 7 data points.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

# Same plot, but showing just the last week
ga_plot <- ggplot(ga_data_plot, mapping = aes(x = time_period)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ga_data_plot$metric_all), color = "#07077D", size = 0.75) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = cutoff_time_period), 
             color = "gray40", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, max_y)) +

<div class="my-footer-right">&#64;tgwilson</div>

<!--
We've gone from 7 weeks of data to 42 days of data.
-->


## We have the data of interest...

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

# Same plot, with the "training data highlighted"data of interest highlighted
ga_plot <- ggplot(ga_data_plot, mapping = aes(x = time_period)) +

<div class="my-footer-right">&#64;tgwilson</div>

<!--
The last 7 data points are our data of interest.
-->


## ...and data for context.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

# Same plot, with the training data highlighted
ga_plot <- ggplot(ga_data_plot, mapping = aes(x = time_period)) +

<div class="my-footer-right">&#64;tgwilson</div>

<!--
And the preceding 42 data points are our data for context. The way we know that the most
recent week was down is because we visually compared it to the preceding 6 weeks.
-->


## Let's take our context data...

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

# Same plot, with the training data highlighted
ga_plot <- ggplot(ga_data_plot, mapping = aes(x = time_period)) +

## ...and think of it as "training" data.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

<!--
And think of it as training data. We're going to use it to build a model using time-series
decomposition as part of the Holt-Winters forecasting method.
-->


## We can "decompose" that data.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

# Decompose the time-series data
ga_decomp <- decompose(ga_data_ts) 

# Convert that to a long format data frame
ga_decomp_df <- data.frame(
  Actual = ga_decomp$x,
  Seasonal = ga_decomp$seasonal,
  Trend = ga_decomp$trend,
  Random = ga_decomp$random) %>%
  mutate(time_period = ga_data_training$time_period) %>%
  gather(key, value, -time_period)

# We want to control the order of the output, so make key a factor
ga_decomp_df$key <- factor(ga_decomp_df$key,
                           levels = c("Actual", "Seasonal", "Trend", "Random"))

# The first plot will only show the Actual data. We'll build up each successive component
# on subsequent slides.
ga_decomp_df_plot <- ga_decomp_df %>%
  mutate(value = ifelse(key == "Actual", value, NA))
  
# Plot the values
ga_plot <- ggplot(ga_decomp_df_plot, mapping = aes(x = time_period, y = value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(key ~ ., scales = "free", switch = "y") +
  default_theme +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())

ga_plot

```

<div class="my-footer-left"><img src="images/demystified.png" style="height: 22px;"/></div>
<div class="my-footer-right">&#64;tgwilson</div>

<!--
We start with our actual data. This is exactly what showed in the previous slide. It's just
been squashed and stretched out a bit. We see that the data has a consistent weekly cycle.
This cycle is seasonality. It's not an annual seasonality like we may be used to -- where
there is back to school and holiday and so on -- but it is still seasonality. So, the first
step in decomposing the data is to figure out the best fit for that weekly seasonality. In
other words, what repeating pattern explains as much of the actual results as possible?
-->


## We can "decompose" that data.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

# The second plot will only show the Actual and Seasonal data. We'll build up each successive component
# on subsequent slides.
ga_decomp_df_plot <- ga_decomp_df %>%
  mutate(value = ifelse(key == "Actual" | key == "Seasonal", value, NA))
  
# Plot the values
ga_plot <- ggplot(ga_decomp_df_plot, mapping = aes(x = time_period, y = value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(key ~ ., scales = "free", switch = "y") +
  default_theme +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())

ga_plot

```

<div class="my-footer-left"><img src="images/demystified.png" style="height: 22px;"/></div>
<div class="my-footer-right">&#64;tgwilson</div>

<!--
This is the seasonal component of the data. Notice how this is an exactly recurring pattern.
Each Monday is exactly the same value. Each Tuesday is also exactly the same value -- a different
value from Monday, but the same value for every Tuesday. 
-->


## We can "decompose" that data.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

# The third plot will only show the Actual, Seasonal, and Trend data. 
ga_decomp_df_plot <- ga_decomp_df %>%
  mutate(value = ifelse(key != "Random", value, NA))
  
# Plot the values
ga_plot <- ggplot(ga_decomp_df_plot, mapping = aes(x = time_period, y = value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(key ~ ., scales = "free", switch = "y") +
  default_theme +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())

ga_plot

```

<div class="my-footer-left"><img src="images/demystified.png" style="height: 22px;"/></div>
<div class="my-footer-right">&#64;tgwilson</div>

<!--
We can now subtract out this seasonal component from the actual values and apply 
exponentional smoothing -- a moving average, essentially -- to get the trend component of the 
data.
-->


## We can "decompose" that data.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

# The final plot will show all of the data.
ga_decomp_df_plot <- ga_decomp_df 
  
# Plot the values
ga_plot <- ggplot(ga_decomp_df_plot, mapping = aes(x = time_period, y = value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(key ~ ., scales = "free", switch = "y") +
  default_theme +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())

ga_plot

```

<div class="my-footer-left"><img src="images/demystified.png" style="height: 22px;"/></div>
<div class="my-footer-right">&#64;tgwilson</div>

<!--
Finally, we take the seasonal value plus the trend value and subtract that from the actual value.
What's left is the noise. Or, the random component of the signal. So, now, if we pick any date
in this data set, we can add the seasonal value, the trend value, and the random value, and they
will exactly total up to the actual value.

With this decomposition, we can now use the first two components to build a forecase for the next
seven days. The seasonal component is super easy, as we just repeat the pattern we established for
another seven days. Extending the trend is a bit more involved, but we can see that there is a
trend that we could fairly readily extend out for another seven days.
-->


## We can now build our forecast.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

# Same plot, with the training data highlighted
ga_plot <- ggplot(ga_data_plot, mapping = aes(x = time_period)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ga_data_plot$metric_training), color = "#07077D", size = 0.75) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = cutoff_time_period), 
             color = "gray40", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ga_data_plot$fit), color = "gray50", linetype = "dotted", size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, max_y)) +
  default_theme

ga_plot

```

<div class="my-footer-left"><img src="images/demystified.png" style="height: 22px;"/></div>
<div class="my-footer-right">&#64;tgwilson</div>

<!--
When we add the forecasts for the seasonal component and the trend component together, we
get an overall forecast by day.
-->


## The forecast won't be perfect.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

# Same plot, with the forecasted value shown
ga_plot <- ggplot(ga_data_plot, mapping = aes(x = time_period)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ga_data_plot$metric_training), color = "#07077D", size = 0.75) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = cutoff_time_period), 
             color = "gray40", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ga_data_plot$fit), color = "gray50", linetype = "dotted", size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, max_y)) +
  default_theme

ga_plot

```

<div class="my-footer-left"><img src="images/demystified.png" style="height: 22px;"/></div>
<div class="my-footer-right">&#64;tgwilson</div>

<!--
We know the forecast will not be perfect. No forecast is. But, we can estimate how close to the
actual results we expect the forecast to be by using the random component of the time-series
decomposition we did earlier. If the random component did not vary that much from day to day,
then we expect our forecast to be pretty close to the actual results. If it varied drastically,
though, then we know that the actual results may differ quite a bit from our forecast. Essentially,
we use that random component's variability to build a prediction interval.
-->


## So we add a prediction interval

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

# Same plot, with the prediction interval added
ga_plot <- ggplot(ga_data_plot, mapping = aes(x = time_period)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = ga_data_plot$lwr, ymax = ga_data_plot$upr), fill = "gray90") +
  geom_line(aes(y = ga_data_plot$metric_training), color = "#07077D", size = 0.75) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = cutoff_time_period), 
             color = "gray40", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ga_data_plot$fit), color = "gray50", linetype = "dotted", size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, max_y)) +
  default_theme

ga_plot

```

<div class="my-footer-left"><img src="images/demystified.png" style="height: 22px;"/></div>
<div class="my-footer-right">&#64;tgwilson</div>

<!--
This is a 95% prediction interval. A prediction interval is similar to a confidence interval. What
the gray band represents is the range for which we expect, all things being stable, the actual 
results to fall within 95% of the time.
-->

## We can compare!

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

# Same plot, with the actuals shown
ga_plot <- ggplot(ga_data_plot, mapping = aes(x = time_period)) +

  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = cutoff_time_period), 
             color = "gray40", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = ga_data_plot$fit), color = "gray50", linetype = "dotted", size = 1) +

<div class="my-footer-left"><img src="images/demystified.png" style="height: 22px;"/></div>
<div class="my-footer-right">&#64;tgwilson</div>

<!--
So, now, we add our actual results back onto the chart.
-->


## Now we have meaningful context! 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4.75}

<!--
This provides meaningful context. We can see that, for 4 out of 5 weekdays last week, our actual
results for the metric were below the 95% prediction interval for the data. It appears the results
were likely not due just to noise. We likely should dig into this data to determine what the 
root cause of the change was.

And, that's really it. That's the Holt-Winters forecasting method explained at a high-level,
as well as an illustration of it being put to use.

If you are using Adobe Analytics, you have now just seen how their platform performs anomaly
detection and how intelligent alerts work within the platform. Obviously, there are some nuances
to their approach.
